To address the train scheduling problem, we formulate it as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and implement it using Gurobi in Python. The goal is to maximize total profit from scheduled train activities while respecting journey continuity, event point usage, and conflict constraints.

### Mathematical Optimization Model

**Sets:**

- \(T\): Trains
- \(A_t\): Activities for train \(t \in T\) (start, run, wait, end)
- \(E\): Global event points (station, time)
- \(V_t\): Physical event nodes for train \(t\) (excluding artificial source/sink)
- \(S\): Conflicting event point sets (mutually exclusive)

**Decision Variables:**

- \(x\_{t,a} \in \{0,1\}\): 1 if activity \(a\) is scheduled for train \(t\)
- \(z\_{t,e} \in \{0,1\}\): 1 if train \(t\) uses event point \(e\)

**Objective:**
Maximize total profit:
\[
\text{Maximize} \sum*{t \in T} \sum*{a \in A*t} \text{profit}*{t,a} \cdot x\_{t,a}
\]

**Constraints:**

1. **Journey Continuity (Flow Conservation):** For each train \(t\) and physical event node \(v \in V*t\):
   \[
   \sum*{\substack{a \in A*t \\ \text{head}(a) = v}} x*{t,a} = \sum*{\substack{a \in A_t \\ \text{tail}(a) = v}} x*{t,a}
   \]

2. **At Most One Start per Train:** For each train \(t\):
   \[
   \sum*{\substack{a \in A_t \\ a \text{ is start}}} x*{t,a} \leq 1
   \]

3. **Link Activity to Event Usage:** For each train \(t\) and event \(e\):
   \[
   z*{t,e} \geq x*{t,a} \quad \forall a \in A*t \text{ using } e
   \]
   \[
   z*{t,e} \leq \sum*{\substack{a \in A_t \\ a \text{ uses } e}} x*{t,a}
   \]

4. **Single Train per Event Point:** For each event point \(e \in E\):
   \[
   \sum*{t \in T} z*{t,e} \leq 1
   \]

5. **Conflict Constraints:** For each conflicting set \(s \in S\):
   \[
   \sum*{e \in s} \sum*{t \in T} z\_{t,e} \leq 1
   \]

### Explanation:

1. **Decision Variables:**

   - `x[t, a]`: Binary, 1 if activity `a` is scheduled for train `t`.
   - `z[t, e]`: Binary, 1 if train `t` uses event point `e`.

2. **Constraints:**

   - **Journey Continuity:** Ensures each train's activities form a continuous path (flow conservation at physical nodes).
   - **One Start per Train:** Each train starts at most once.
   - **Activity-Event Link:** Ties activity scheduling to event point usage.
   - **Event Usage:** Each event point used by at most one train.
   - **Conflict Handling:** At most one event point per conflicting set is used.

3. **Objective:** Maximizes total profit from scheduled activities.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - `activities`: Maps each train to its possible activities.
   - `event_mapping`: Defines nodes, incoming/outgoing activities per node, and events per activity.
   - `conflicting_sets`: Groups of mutually exclusive event points.
   - `profits`: Profit values for each (train, activity) pair.

The code creates an MILP model, sets up constraints, optimizes, and outputs the schedule. Adjust the dummy data to match your specific railway network and requirements.
